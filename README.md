## What is AI Productivity Enhancer?

In a world full of digital distractions, AI Productivity Enhancer is your personal assistant for focus. It's a smart Android application designed to help you regain control over your time by monitoring your app usage and helping you block distracting applications when you need to concentrate.

Whether you want to manually block apps for a study session or let our AI intelligently manage your usage patterns, this app provides the tools you need to enhance your productivity.

## Key Features

*   **Two Modes for Full Control:**
    *   **Manual Mode:** Gives you direct control. See a list of all your apps and simply press "Block" on any app you want to restrict. The app will be blocked instantly.
    *   **Auto Mode (AI):** Let our smart agent help you. Set daily usage limits for categories like "Entertainment" and "Gaming". The AI will monitor your usage and automatically block apps that exceed their limits.

*   **Usage Tracking:** See how much time you spend on different apps each day. This insight helps you understand your habits and make informed decisions about what to block.

*   **Smart AI:** The AI in Auto Mode is designed to be helpful, not frustrating. It learns from your manual unblocks and will stop blocking an app if you consistently need access to it.

*   **Full Transparency:** In Auto Mode, you can see exactly which of your apps are categorized as "Entertainment" or "Gaming", so you're always in the loop about what the AI is doing.

## Getting Started

To get the full power of the AI Productivity Enhancer, you need to grant two permissions after installing the app. The app will not function correctly without them.

1.  **Enable Accessibility Service:** This is the most important step. This permission is what allows the app to block other applications. When you open the app, you will see a button and a warning if this service is not enabled. Tap it to go to your phone's settings and turn on the service for "AI Productivity Enhancer".

2.  **Enable Usage Access:** This permission allows the app to track how much time you spend on other apps. This is necessary for the usage meters and for the AI to make smart decisions in Auto Mode. The app will prompt you to enable this when it's needed.

Once the permissions are set, you're ready to start blocking distractions and boosting your focus!"# AI_ProductivityEnhancerApp"
